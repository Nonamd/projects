<p>Do You Really Want a Hook-up</p>
<p>So, still red hot for our friend, huh? You're pretty insistent on a hook-up.  Well, The UVC Team is planning a hook-up for you; we'll get some photos before because you will be a red hot mess by the end.  See you soon. And don't worry about a ride, we'll come pick you up...</p>

<p>Wow <name>, You're a pretty persistent person. I suppose the folks at <work> like that about you.  I guess they all know that you don't like anybody clowning around. But, what if we send in the Clowns <name>? What if a little car filled with deranged men in painted faces shows up and they drag your sorry ass into their fun-mobile and decide to Clown Around all over your duct-taped body? Persistence doesn't trump duct tape <name>; nothing does! Meet you after work, we'll be the ones with the red curly hair...</p>

<p>Yeah <name>, you are not getting the message about leaving our friend alone. We recently dealt with another guy like you. In fact, We're just sitting by the lake with him now, and letting him soak in the decisions to move on.  In fact, he's well past moving on, so now we can focus all our energy on you <name>.  We're so good at helping people move, we started a moving company.  Keep an eye out for our "Moving On Van,"  afterall, we'll be keeping our eyes out for you. </p>

<p>So many times we think we are just slipping through life unnoticed <name>, but what if someone is noticing you. You know that feeling when you think you are alone in an elevator, but you check behind yourself anyway, <name>.  Some people have a lot of fear of elevators because elevators can be damn creepy places. Stalkers are creepy too. Stalkers with teddybears and big ass knives in elevators...now <name>, that has bad day written all over it. We're coming to push your buttons <name> and you'll be going down. </p>

<p><name>, you win.  We're getting all dolled up, and we're coming over to your place.  When you're sleeping tonight, we'll climb in that little access route we found while you were at <work>.  To make it even more special, we'll surprise you with our slinky lingerie.  Oh, and <name>, we have a few men like you that we need to "visit" so if we don't make it over tonight, we'll come another time. After all <name>, we walk by your house every night.</p>
